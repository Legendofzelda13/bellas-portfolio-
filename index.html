        My bio My name is Isabella gonzalez I was born in Houston Tx and I am a Mexican Latina. In 2017 I moved here to Austin tx because of hurricane Harvey. It was scary to be leaving so soon away from family and friends but I adjusted. Ive always wanted to learn coding as a back up plan for my future career and found it was actually enjoyable and fun. My hobbies include playing the piano, playing the violin, drawing, baking, running, and playing basketball. My education is at west ridge middle school and my career goals are at least 4 main options. Computer Programmer, Lawyer, Creative Writer, and animator/graphic designer.  -bella.G
